## Technology :

+ **React js** - ( React.js is a JavaScript framework, Which is very popular because of it's extra simplicity and flexibility.)
+ **React-Router-dom** - ( React Router is used to define multiple routes in the application. When a user types a specific URL into the browser, and if this URL path matches any   'route' inside the router file, the user will be redirected to that particular route.)
+ **Axios** - (Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from node. js  and it supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6.It also has the ability to cancel requests.)

+ **Material-UI** - (Material-UI provides an optional CssBaseline component. It fixes some inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.)

## Steps :

+ Started design with following task which i got.
+ Started design with following task which i got.make component for each part to make the code more readable .
+ By using react-typical, animate some text for better user experience .
+ Used a background animation for look the UI more eye catching .
+ Made a button for fetching data from API and show the job status to the user. Status will showing after clicking the button

## How to compile and run the application -
+ Take the git clone url and open your terminal and run the project "git clone {your copied git clone url}"
+ Download the project and unzip the downloaded folder than open it in your code editor .
+ After opening your project in your code editor run "npm install/yarn install" to get all the dependencies which included in that project .
+ After completing the installation, then use the API link and secret key properly in your code(I hide it to make the API more secured) .
+ Then use "npm start/yarn start" in your command line and it will automatically open your localhost:3000. Hurrah! you will see an outstanding web application.ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
